# Tic-Tac-Toe1

In this stage, you should analyze a Tic-Tac-Toe field. 

Note. In this stage either 'X' or 'O' can start the game.

After printing the field, you need to find the state in which the game is at the moment. Possible states:

"Game not finished" - when no side has a three in a row but the field has empty cells;
"Draw" - when no side has a three in a row and the field has no empty cells;
"X wins" - when the field has three X in a row;
"O wins" - when the field has three O in a row;
"Impossible" - when the field has three X in a row as well as three O in a row. Or the field has a lot more X's that O's or vice versa (if the difference is 2 or more, should be 1 or 0).
Also, you can use ' ' or '_' to print empty cells - it's up to you.
